Ladybud Roll was created by Jesse Jurman, with art done by Ethan Jurman. Special thanks to Ethan Jurman, Tina Howard, and Elijah Hogge for playtesting, and Patrícia Mendes for UX and Accessibility consultation.

This game was created for the [Games For Blind Gamers 4](https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers-4) game jam.

The game was built with the LÖVE / Love2d engine, and made accessible using the [love-a11y-template](https://github.com/JRJurman/love-a11y-template) (created for this project).

Music and Sound Effects were created by Jesse Jurman using Pico-8.
